# GitHub Destop Vs CLI
When i started using Github, I downloaded GitHub desktop to circumvent the CLI.
I still find it much faster to commit and push changes to my projects using GitHub Desktop. for example to commitm and push a single file to my repository

## Using GH Desktop:
1. Click "commit to master"
2. Click "push origin" button twice
3. Done.


  ### Using Command Line
  1. git add filename
  2. git commit
  3. git push origin master.
